******************

**Notepad++** can have very basic support for syntax highlighting **igor** files.

To install Igor support, perform the following steps:

1) Download syntax definition XML from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igorlang/igor/refs/heads/main/extras/userDefineLang.xml
2) In Notepad++ go to **Language**/**Define your language...** menu, press **Import...** button and browse to the userDefineLang.xml you've just downloaded.
